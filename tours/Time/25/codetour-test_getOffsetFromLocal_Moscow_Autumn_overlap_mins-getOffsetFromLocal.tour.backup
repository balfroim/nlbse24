    "content": "This code snippet is part of the Joda-Time library and is related to computing the parsed datetime by setting the saved fields. It is used internally to calculate the milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z based on the parsed fields.\n\nThe method `computeMillis` takes two parameters: `resetFields` and `text`. The `resetFields` parameter, when set to true, clears unsaved field values. The `text` parameter is an optional text being parsed, to be included in any error message.\n\nThe method first sorts the saved fields and then iterates through them to compute the millis value. It also handles the time zone offset and transition to ensure the correctness of the computed millis.\n\nIf any field is out of range, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. Additionally, if there is an issue with the time zone offset transition, an IllegalArgumentException is also thrown.\n\nOverall, this method is an important part of the Joda-Time library's internal functionality for computing the milliseconds based on the parsed fields and handling time zone offsets. It is not typically used directly in application code but is crucial for the proper functioning of date and time parsing in the library."
